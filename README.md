# bb4-sound


Library project for creating sounds, music, and speech synthesis.
Note: Much of this code came from two sources (though extensive modifications have been made)
  1) MidiSynch by Brian Lichtenwalter. The Sun copyright as been maintained in the relevant files.
  2) [Java Speech Synthesizer](http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2001/jw-0817-javatalk.html?page=1) by LOTONtech.

### How to Build
Type 'gradle build' at the root. This will build everything, but since its a library project there won't be much to see.
If you want to open the source in Intellij, then first run 'gradle idea'.

When there is a new release, versioned artifacts will be published by Barry Becker to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org).
